Daily Coding Problem #182

## Asked by

## Description

```
# A graph is minimally-connected if it is connected and there is no edge that can be removed 
# while still leaving the graph connected. For example, any binary tree is minimally-connected.
# Given an undirected graph, check if the graph is minimally-connected. You can choose to
# represent the graph as either an adjacency matrix or adjacency list.
```

## Solution

```python
# Suppose we have a graph that is not minimally-connected. That means that there exists an edge
# (u, v) in the graph that, if we remove it, would still have a path from u to v. This means
# that there must be a cycle in the graph along u and v. Conversely, if there is no cycle, then
# the graph is minimally-connected. We can run DFS on the graph to detect a cycle, and return
# false if there is one.

# However, an easier way to look at this is to simply notice that each vertex must have exactly # one edge coming from it, which means that there must be n - 1 edges in the graph. So we can
# also simply count up the number of edges in the graph and check if it's equal to n - 1.

def minimally_connected(graph):
    n = len(graph)
    num_edges = 0
    for v, edges in graph.items():
        num_edges += len(edges)
    num_edges //= 2
    return n - 1 == num_edges

# This takes O(V + E) time.
```
