This is another LeetCode Day

## Difficulty:

**Easy**

## Description：

Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes 
with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree 
has exactly two or zero sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, 
then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes.

Given such a binary tree, you need to output the second minimum 
value in the set made of all the nodes' value in the whole tree.

If no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead. 

## Example1：

```
Input: 
    2
   / \
  2   5
     / \
    5   7

Output: 5

Explanation: The smallest value is 2, the second smallest value is 5.
```

## Example2：

```
Input: 
    2
   / \
  2   2

Output: -1

Explanation: The smallest value is 2, but there isn't any second smallest value.
```

## Solution：

```
