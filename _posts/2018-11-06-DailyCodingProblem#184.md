Daily Coding Problem #184

## Difficulty

**Easy**

## Asked by

**Amazon**

## Description

```
Given n numbers, find the greatest common denominator between them.

For example, given the numbers [42, 56, 14], return 14.
```

## Solution

```python
# Because the greatest common divisor is associative, gcd of multiple 
# numbers: say, a, b, c is equivalent to gcd(gcd(a, b), c). Intuitively, 
# this is because if d divides gcd(a, b) and c, it must divide a and b as 
# well by the definition of the greatest common divisor.

# Thus the greatest common divisor of multiple numbers a, b, ..., z can 
# be obtained by iteratively computing the gcd of a and b, and gcd of the 
# result of that with c, and so on.

def gcd(nums):
    n = nums[0]
    for num in nums[1:]:
        n = _gcd(n, num)
    return n

# How to implement _gcd() though? A naive implementation might try every 
# integer from 1 to min(a, b) and see if it divides the larger:

def _gcd_naive(a, b):
    smaller, larger = min(a, b), max(a, b)
    for d in range(smaller, 0, -1):
        if larger % d == 0:
            return d
# However, a much more efficient method is the Euclidean algorithm to 
# find the the greatest common divisor, which follows the recursive formula:

gcd(a, 0) = a
gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b)
def _gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return _gcd(b, a & b)

# A more memory-efficient method that works bottom up:

def _gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
