This is another LeetCode Day

## Difficulty:

**Easy**

## Description：

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. 
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two 
nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

## Example：

```
INPUT:
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5 
      
OUTPUT: 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

```

## Note :

- The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

## Solution：

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """
        self.ans = 1
        def depth(node):
            if not node: return 0
            L = depth(node.left)
            R = depth(node.right)
            self.ans = max(self.ans, L+R+1)
            return max(L, R) + 1

        depth(root)
        return self.ans - 1
```
